The Trauma and orthopaedic team care for a range of trauma related injuries and conditions, with each patient’s treatment managed to their needs. Our clinics run every day; however these are specialist clinics to ensure that patients are seen by the appropriate consultant for specialised care.",
  "extraDetails": "To ensure patients are and treated in the appropriate clinic patients are first referred to our Virtual Fracture Clinic. Patient’s individual cases are discussed alongside one of our consultants to determine the appropriate clinic for the patient to attend in our department. This ensures that patients are not delayed in clinic and do not have to be re-referred to other departments or consultants, which can hold up their treatment and hinder recovery.",
