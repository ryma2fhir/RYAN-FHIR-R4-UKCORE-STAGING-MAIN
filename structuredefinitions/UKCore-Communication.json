  "description": "This profile defines the UK constraints and extensions on the International FHIR resource [Communication](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/Communication.html).",
  "purpose": "The purpose of this profile is to allow a record of a communication even if it is planned or has failed. A communication is a conveyance of information from one entity, a sender, to another entity, a receiver. The sender and receivers may be patients, practitioners, related persons, organisations, or devices. Communication use cases include: \r\n- A reminder or alert delivered to a responsible provider \r\n\r\n- A recorded notification from a nurse to the on-call physician (or any other specified person) that a patient's temperature exceeds a value \r\n\r\n- A notification to a public health agency of a patient presenting with a communicable disease reportable to the public health agency \r\n\r\n- Educational material sent by a provider to an individual \r\n\r\n- Unable to deliver laboratory results to the appropriate care practitioners",
