  "description": "This profile defines the UK constraints and extensions on the International FHIR resource [Location](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/Location.html).",
  "purpose": "This profile can be used to exchange details and position information for a physical place where services are provided and resources and participants may be stored, found, contained, or accommodated.\r\n\r\nA location includes both incidental locations (a place which is used for healthcare without prior designation or authorisation) and dedicated, formally appointed locations. Locations may be private, public, mobile or fixed and scale from small freezers to full hospital buildings or parking garages.",
