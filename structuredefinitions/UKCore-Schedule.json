  "description": "This profile defines the UK constraints and extensions on the International FHIR resource [Schedule](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/Schedule.html).",
  "purpose": "Schedule resources provide a container for time-slots that can be booked using an appointment. It provides the window of time (period) that slots are defined for and what type of appointments can be booked.\r\n\r\nThe schedule does not provide any information about actual appointments. This separation greatly assists where access to the appointments would not be permitted for security or privacy reasons, while still being able to determine if an appointment might be available.",
