  "description": "Defines the additional constraints and extensions on the UK Core Observation profile, for recording if a patient is breathing room air, or inspired oxygen.",
  "purpose": "To provide implementers with additional support when implementing recording of whether a patient is breathing on their own, or is on oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe clinical observations within scope of this profile include all patient respiration: Unaided, Oxygen Concentrators, Nasal Cannula, CPAP Devices, Endotracheal Tube, and Mechanical Ventilator.",
