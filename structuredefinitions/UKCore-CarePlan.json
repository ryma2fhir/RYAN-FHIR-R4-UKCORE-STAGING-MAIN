  "description": "This profile defines the UK constraints and extensions on the International FHIR resource [CarePlan](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/CarePlan.html).",
  "purpose": "This profile allows recording of care plans which are used in many areas of healthcare with a variety of scopes. They can be as simple as a general practitioner keeping track of when an individual is next due for a tetanus immunisation through to a detailed plan for an oncology patient covering diet, chemotherapy, radiation, lab work and counselling with detailed timing relationships, pre-conditions and goals.",
