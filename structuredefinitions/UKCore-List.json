  "description": "This profile defines the UK constraints and extensions on the International FHIR resource [List](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/List.html).",
  "purpose": "This profile allows exchange of a flat, possibly ordered collection of records. \r\n\r\nThe list profile can be used in many places, including allergies, medications, alerts, family history, medical history, etc. This list profile can be used to support individual-specific clinical lists as well as lists that manage workflows such as tracking patients, managing teaching cases, etc. \r\n\r\nThe list profile supports lists that are homogeneous – consisting of only one type of resource (e.g. Allergy lists) as well as heterogeneous – containing a variety of resources (e.g. a problem list including Condition, AllergyIntolerance, Procedure, etc.).",
