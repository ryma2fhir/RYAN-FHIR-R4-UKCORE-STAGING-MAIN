  "description": "This profile defines the UK constraints and extensions on the International FHIR resource [EpisodeOfCare](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/EpisodeOfCare.html).",
  "purpose": "This profile allows exchange of information about an association between a patient and an organisation / healthcare providers during which time encounters may occur. The managing organisation assumes a level of responsibility for the individual during this time.\r\n\r\n   #### Relationship to Encounter \r\n The EpisodeOfCare Resource contains information about an association of a Patient with a Healthcare Provider for a period of time under which related healthcare activities may occur. In many cases, this represents a period of time where the Healthcare Provider has some level of responsibility for the care of the patient regarding a specific condition or problem, even if not currently participating in an encounter. These resources are typically known in existing systems as: \r\n- **EpisodeOfCare:** Case, Program, Problem, Episode \r\n- **Encounter:** Visit, Contact.",
