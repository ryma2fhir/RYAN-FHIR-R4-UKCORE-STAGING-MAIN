  "purpose": "This profile allows a record of a set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. \r\n\r\nA Composition defines the structure and narrative content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not constitute a document. Rather, the Composition SHALL be the first entry in a Bundle where `Bundle.type=document`, and any other resources referenced from Composition SHALL be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle, for example Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.",
