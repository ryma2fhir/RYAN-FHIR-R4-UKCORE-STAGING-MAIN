  "description": "This profile defines the UK constraints and extensions on the International FHIR resource [CareTeam](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/CareTeam.html).",
  "purpose": "This profile allows recording of the care team which includes all the people and organisations who plan to participate in the coordination and delivery of care for an individual. This is not limited to practitioners, but may include other caregivers such as family members, guardians, the individual themselves, or others. The care team, depending on where used, may include care team members specific to a particular care plan, an episode, an encounter, or may reflect all known team members across these perspectives. An individual's care team can be dynamic over time, such that there can be transience of team members, such as a rehabilitation team.",
