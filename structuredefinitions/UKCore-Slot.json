  "purpose": "Slot resources are used to provide time-slots that can be booked using an appointment. They do not provide any information about appointments that are available, just the time, and optionally what the time can be used for. These are effectively spaces of free/busy time.\r\nSlots can also be marked as busy without having appointments associated.",
