  "purpose": "This extension SHALL be used with the HL7 core-defined extension [coding-sctdescid](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-coding-sctdescid.html) to support the exchange of the selected description display term for a SNOMED CT concept, where the selected display term is different to the preferred term. \rThe description display term associated with the ID within the coding-sctdescid extension is important to enable the representation of the exact term that was entered by the clinician that recorded the data, or the exact term that a legacy code e.g. a Read v2 code has been translated to using an assured mapping table.",
